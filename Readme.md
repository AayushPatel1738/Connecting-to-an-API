Connecting to an API 


1) This was my first time using Jquery without any prior knowledge

2) Utilizes the Dog API "https://dog.ceo/dog-api/" -- which basically
fetches random dog images

3) When you click on the button "Get a dog", it uses the API
as the source and retrives the image being generated and fectched and 
displays it on a web browser
